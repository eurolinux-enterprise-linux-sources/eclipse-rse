<h1>Using the Remote System Explorer API</h1>
<p>In addition to all the programming API provided by Eclipse, the Remote System Explorer itself
comes with numerous classes and interfaces that may be of value to programmers extending the RSE.
Typically, these are used in conjunction with the <a href="Extensions.html">extension points</a>
defined by the RSE.
<p>
The API set supplied by the RSE can be roughly partitioned into three areas:
<ol>
<li><a href="api/uiAPI.html">User interface</a> support, to make it easier to author plug-ins that extend or use the RSE.
<li><a href="api/resourceAPI.html">Remote resources</a> support, to enable access to remote resources via predefined subsystems.
<li><a href="api/modelAPI.html">Model</a> support, to enable traversal of the RSE model, to access connections, subsystem factories, subsystems, filters, and so on.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This guide will introduce the capabilities of the API, leaving the programming details to the 
reference section.</p>
